I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [University of Maryland, College Park](http://www.umd.edu), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. John Dickerson](http://jpdickerson.com). 
Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics from [Bryn Mawr College](http://www.brynmawr.edu).
My research focuses on understanding and enriching the reasoning capabilities of current deep learning models. I believe having the ability to reason is an important and necessary step to achieving general intelligence.

Across my Ph.D., I have interned at [DeepMind](http://deepmind.com) under the supervision of [Dr. Petar Veličković](https://petar-v.com), working on how to re-use the learned knowledge and skills in reinforcement learning.  
I have also worked closely with [Prof. Jimmy Ba](http://jimmylba.github.io) and [Prof. Taiji Suziki](http://ibis.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/suzuki) when doing research internships at [Vector Institute](http://vectorinstitute.ai) and [RIKEN AIP](http://aip.riken.jp). 
During my research, I also received great guidance from [Prof. Don Perlis](http://www.cs.umd.edu/users/perlis), [Prof. Furong Huang](http://furong-huang.com), and [Prof. Justin Brody](http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/people/jbrody).

# <p><strong>I am looking for internship opportunities for summer 2022. Here is my <a href="assets/pdf/latest.pdf">CV</a>. Let me know if you think I can be a good fit.</strong></p>
